# edk2-oneplus5
Attempt to create a minimal EDK2 for OnePlus 5.

## Status
Can load GRUB2 from a fat partition on the UFS.


### Working
* Continuous Display
* UFS Storage
* ...

### Not Working
* ...

## Building
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 & Arch Linux.

First, clone EDK2:
```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git --recursive
git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms.git
```

You should have all three directories (`edk2`, `edk2-platforms` & `edk2-oneplus5`) side by side.

Next, install the dependencies:

Ubuntu 20.04:
```
sudo apt install build-essential uuid-dev acpica-tools git nasm python3-pip gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu abootimg p7zip-full bsdiff
sudo pip3 install uefi_firmware
```

Arch Linux:
```
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel acpica git nasm python aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc p7zip bsdiff
yay -S --needed abootimg-git uefi-firmware-parser-git
```

Then, extract the XBL binary from your device (the powerful `dd` will serve you), name it `xbl.elf` and place it in the current directory.

Now execute `./extract-xbl.sh` to get the proprietary blobs extracted.  
If you just cloned this, also run `./firstrun.sh`.  
Finally, `./build.sh`.

Then `fastboot boot uefi.img`.
